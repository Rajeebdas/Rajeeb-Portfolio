 1. Design & Layout
Style: Modern, clean, and slightly tech-oriented.

Colors: Dark theme with high contrast (white text on dark background).

Typography: Clear and consistent.

Spacing: Good use of margins and padding; doesnâ€™t feel cramped.

Layout: One-page scroll with anchored sections.

âœ… 2. Responsiveness
Appears well-optimized for desktop.

Need to ensure all elements scale correctly on mobile (e.g., navbar and project cards).

âœ… 3. Navigation Flow
Smooth scroll behavior.

Sticky navigation bar.

Sections are in logical order: Home â†’ About â†’ Skills â†’ Projects â†’ Contact.

âœ… 4. Content Clarity
Name and profession visible upfront.

Skills are clearly listed.

Project cards are visual and easy to understand.

Contact form is included and works intuitively.

âœ… 5. Project Presentation
Each project has:

Title

Layout with image preview + text is effective.

Hover effects add interactivity.

âœ… 6. UI/UX
Animations on scroll look smooth.

Interactive hover effects are subtle.

Cursor pointer changes are implemented well.

CTA buttons ("Hire Me", "View Resume") are visible and accessible.
